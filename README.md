# CS547-Assignment01

## Synopsis
This Java program provides implementations of searhc problems looking
for a given string, using hill-climbling, simulated annealing and
genetic algorithms, comparing the results gained from these algorithms.

The program allows for the tweaking of parameters within these
algorithms as part of the benchmarking.
